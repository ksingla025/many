MANY updates : 
 A. MANY now uses the new version of Sphinx4. 
    1. LanguageModelOnServer class has been replaced by NetworkLanguageModel (working is the same). 
    2. Scripts for generating MANY configuration has been modified to reflect the changes (see gen_MANY_config.pl in scripts directory).
    3. LargeNGramModel class can now be used to load ngram LM (whatever is n) instead of NetworkLanguageModel

 B. Multithreading
    1. Multithreading has been included in MANY so that Confusion Networks can be created in parallel.
    2. A new variable has appeared in MANY.sh : nb_threads. If its value is greater than 1 then multithreding will operate.

 C. Parameter optimization
    1. Several scripts can now be used to optimize parameters with CONDOR. CONDOR optimizer can be found on the tools directory.
        1.1 Tuning all parameters together : 
            - Optimize_MANY_template.sh
            - gen_MANY_config.pl
        1.2 Tuning parameters in 2-steps
            a. TERp parameters optimization (deletion, stem, synonyms, insertion, substitution and shift)
                - Optimize_MANYterp_template.sh : 
this actually calls MANYterp and calculate the sum of TERp values between one or several references and the confusion networks.

                - Optimize_MANYbleu_template.sh : 
this actually call MANYbleu and calculate the sum of an approximation of BLEU between one or several references and the confusion networks.

            b. Decoder parameters optimization (fudge factor, null and length penalties).
                - Optimize_MANYdecode_template.sh : 
this actually call MANYdecode; It loads the CN obtained with a parameters optimized at the first step and tune the decoder parameters. 
 
 D. Other updates
