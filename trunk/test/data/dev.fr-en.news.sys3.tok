This year , in the triangle of Budaörs trade , the Christmas Panier normal daily also has risen from 16 % on average , an increase of much higher value thousand forints display is in all the big supermarkets .

This year , more than a thousand infections , caused mainly by the use of antibiotics , have been recorded in hospitals .
Many hospitals are also the economy on disinfectants
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics has been detected on a man hospitalised result has a serious accident .
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in a position place .
Until 10 December this year , 1 094 hospitalieres infections generated by an agent pathogene multirésistant were declared on national Systeme nosocomiale surveillance , has indicated Karolina Böröcz , a doctor at the head of the National Centre of epidemiology .
Approximately two thirds of infection ( 683 infections ) have been caused by the MRSA , in other words by the staphylococcus aureus resistant has the méthicilline-oxacilline .
Infections caused by the SA ( such as angines , amygdalites , skin infections , infection traumatic ) are reacting to antibiotics , they are easily guérissables .
In the event of provisional malfunction or extended the immune systeme , salmonella may cause serious hospitalieres infections , such that a traumatic infection or a septicémie , on the sick old , small weight or having a weakened body .
Above all , we must not confuse the infection with the outbreak , no MRSA only the or it does not seek , said Tibor Nyulasi .
' These patients are isolated , carers puts rubber days and masks of protection and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them ' , said Tibor Nyulasi .
The prélevement the sample is not has the way
As it is especially in the hospitals and the old people ’ s homes , hospitals should monitor patients in hospitals and isolate MRSA immediately the sick people .
We must be aware that the national club of social security is not financing these examinations .
The European Union has a rigorous recommendations concerning has the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian directives for the recovery of certain infection and syndromes .
The achievement of microbiological prélevements is even more rare in outpatient care and in the basic care , gave Böröcz Karolina .
Scientific evidence suggests that the MRSA proliferent of a patient has another more often by means of the medical staff .
The MRSA proliferent by inhalation of mosquito-borne infection called and by contact . However , because of the conditions in the Hungarian hospitals , the patient contaminated cannot always come isolated .
Unfortunately , we also note that hospitals , financiere difficult situation and make savings on disinfectants , they lack infirmieres , patients are many , and the risk of contamination is even greater , has indicated Karolina Böröcz .
