Food : Where European inflation slipped up
November price hikes were higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries , with October 's 2.6 percent yr / yr inflation rate followed by 3.1 percent in November , the EU 's Luxembourg-based statistical office reported .
As opposed to the US , UK , and Canadian central banks , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) did not cut interest rates , arguing that a rate drop combined with rising raw material prices and declining unemployment would trigger an inflationary spiral .
According to one analyst , ECB has been caught in a Catch-22 : It needs to " talk down " inflation , to keep from having to take action to push it down later in the game .
Soaring food and energy prices sent eurozone inflation into the stratosphere .
Consumers also have had to pay significantly more for vegetable oils and dairy products in 2007 .
The ECB predicts that 2008 inflation will climb to 2.5 percent from the earlier 2.1 , but will drop back to 1.9 percent in 2009 .
They also predict that the ECB will cut interest rates twice during the course of 2008 .
Fidesz support shot up significantly in early December after a lengthy period of just holding its own . This gives it the strongest support base it has seen since 2002 , while Gallup reports support for the socialists at an all-time low of 13 percent .
The poll puts MDF and SZDSZ numbers below the threshold needed to get into parliament ; garnering about 2 percent support each within the entire sample .
The public mood regarding the economy has managed to sink even lower than the rock-bottom last measured . The proportion who believe the country 's economy is in the pits is an unprecedented 41 percent , while another 46 percent just think it is in bad shape .
For next year , over half the public expects things to get worse and only one in ten predicts an improvement .
Thirteen percent of the sample said it trusted or highly trusted Ferenc Gyurcsány , while 38 percent put their trust in Viktor Orbán .
One gauge of the political situation is the proportion of people who believe that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be managed without having to put a new government in office .
When queried about interest in a referendum , 60 percent of the sample said it definitely would vote in one , while another 20 percent said it most likely would go to the polls .
74 percent of people want to repeal tuition fees , 79 percent to scrap co-payments for doctor visits and 84 percent want to end per diem hospital charges .
Auchan prices are highest , Tesco 's are up by almost 20 percent
Article from Napi Gazdaság
Since supermarket prices went through the roof last December , the hikes did not look quite as drastic percentage-wise , when compared to that high base .
Napi 's basket exceeded the psychological HUF 10,000 limit by a minimum of HUF 91 at the giant supermarkets tested .
( in 2003 , the same basket came to 6,800 forints . )
We found the price of flour and bread to be mostly in line with official Statistics Office data , though we discovered bread going for 139 forints a kilogram at Auchan .
Another surprise in this store was that it charged less than 200 forints for a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola in a bottle with a deposit on it , so the full price including deposit was still only 257 forints .
We worked the numbers and found that Napi 's basket cost 15 percent more than last Christmas at Cora , while it was 18 percent more expensive at both Tesco and Auchan .
In forints , the average increase was 1,480 .
And this was the factor that totally confused the commerce sector . The supermarkets were obviously unable to decide on the size of the price gap to apply to specific products , finding it impossible to calculate the effect the price increases would have on consumption .
Last year , with the VAT hike the price increase in Napi 's basket ran up against such extremes that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints over the 2006 level , while the cheapest was only 844 forints more expensive .
A comparison of the two Christmas seasons threw light on a disastrous jump in prices . In less than 20 months , day-to-day consumer goods soared by over 30 percent in the giant supermarkets .
including both flour and eggs . )
It does appear though , that flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg producers , for they have managed to force their drastic price increases onto the multinationals .
We found that most shoppers in the three outlets visited were not really interested in prices .
On a Wednesday morning there were long queues at all cash registers following a sudden increase in shoppers .
Many hospitals try to save by cutting disinfectant use
Hospital cleanliness , overcrowding , and overburdened staff are not conducive to halting infections , said the division chief at the National Centre for Epidemiology .
An MRSA - an antibiotic resistant staphylococcus - infection was recently diagnosed in the traumatology ward of János hospital .
The patient was isolated .
It had discharged a patient admitted after a serious traffic accident . Shortly afterward , it had to re-admit the patient because of an MRSA infection , and doctors have been unable to perform surgery that would be vital to full recovery because they have been unable to get rid of the staph .
This tells us the number of cases of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that hospitals actually included in their records , but nothing more .
One-third of all people carry the Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) bacteria in their noses without it ever causing an infection .
However , if antibiotics are overused or inappropriately used , the bacteria that originally responded well to antibiotics can evolve into an antibiotic-resistant variety , which spreads rapidly in hospitals if hygienic conditions are lax .
According to János Hospital 's medical director , there is nothing unusual about having an MRSA infection since they are part of everyday hospital life .
Antibiotic resistance
When a patient is admitted to the hospital , one of the first things done is to check for the presence of MRSA , but hospitals are still vulnerable to infection .
The vast majority of nosocomial MRSA-induced infections could be prevented said Böröcz . However , she added that current hospital conditions are not conducive to preventing the evolvement and spread of antibiotic-resistant infections .
But , taking microbiological samples from patients is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals .
In most cases the bacteria remain unnoticed unless the patient has an obvious MRSA infection , said the National Centre for Epidemiology physician-in-chief .
The goal should be targeted therapy , meaning that microbiology tests should be conducted to prevent resistance from evolving , but hospitals do not always keep to this .
Saving money by cutting back on disinfectants
Therefore , washing hands , and wearing gloves and masks play a significant role in prevention , but here again , we find many shortcomings in hospital practices .
In fact , hospital wards are often overcrowded , with beds too close to one another although they should be at least 1.5 metres apart to conform to epidemiological requirements .
