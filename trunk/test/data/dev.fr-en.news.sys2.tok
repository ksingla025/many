This year , in the triangle of Budaörs Panier , the usual daily Christmas has increased to 16 % on average , increased substantially higher value thousand Forints sported is in all hypermarkets .
However , consumers are obviously shocked to see that Articles bought clearly below nine thousand Forints last year coutent now ten thousand Forints .
And the highest value stood basket of Forints has 10 573 .
The price of the Unicum and fish living remained almost at the level of last year , but the net price Turkey , walnut and poppy have significantly increased .
Competition has not dropped the product price below 200 Forints .
He empeche that this year in term of Panier daily , Auchan was the most expensive and cheapest Cora .

( If a retailer is not the rotation of a product , it risks losing a big profit margin on the appropriate has the intensity of Trade . )
This year , the difference was not if excessive since the value of the basket was more expensive than 630 Forints 1 was that of last year and cheaper prices have increased 1 284 Forints also .
( This does not necessarily confirms the data of KSH alimentations : for some , the statistics institute found a price increase of more than 30 % in 12 months . )

This year , more than a thousand infections , caused mainly by the improper use of antibiotics , have been recorded in hospitals .
Many hospitals are also the economy on disinfectants
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected on a man hospitalised following a serious accident .
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place .
Until 10 December this year , 1 hospitalieres infections 094 generated by an agent pathogene multirésistant were declared the national Systeme monitoring nosocomiale , said Böröcz Karolina , chief doctor of the National Centre of Epidemiology .
Around two-thirds infections ( 683 ) infections were caused by the MRSA , i.e. the Staphylococcus aureus by resistance has the méthicilline-oxacilline .
Infection caused by the SA ( such as angines , amygdalites , skin infections , infections traumatic ) react well to antibiotics , they are easily guérissables .
In case of bad or extended interim functioning of the immune system , the bacteria can cause serious hospitalieres infections , such as a traumatic infection or a septicémie on the sick , elderly , small weight or have a weakened body .
Above all , we must not confuse the infection with the epidemic , there is not only of MRSA or they are not seeking , said Tibor Nyulasi .
" These patients are isolated , nurses floats rubber gloves and masks and we have appropriate antibiotics to treat them , " said Tibor Nyulasi .
The prélevement of the sample is not the way
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and the elderly homes , hospitals should monitor patients in hospitals and immediately isolate the sick carrying MRSA .
That national club Social Security is not financing these tests .
The European Union has stringent recommendations relating has the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian directives for cures for certain infections and syndromes .
The prélevements microbiological is even more rare in the ambulatoires and care in the basic care , gave Karolina Böröcz .
Scientific evidence suggests that the proliferent MRSA of a patient has another most often by medical staff .
The proliferent by MRSA infection transmitted by inhalation of gouttelettes and by contact . But because of the conditions in hospitals , the patient Hungarian contaminated cannot always be isolated .
Unfortunately , we also note that hospitals , financiere difficult situation and make savings on disinfectants , they are infirmieres , patients are many , and the risk of contamination is even greater , Karolina Böröcz said .
