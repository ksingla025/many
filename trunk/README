AUTHORS	
	Loïc BARRAULT - LIUM, University of Le Mans

THANKS	

	CMU and LIUM for having done a great job with the Open Source Sphinx library.
	More particularly Paul Deléglise and Yannick Estève for their help using it.
	M. Snover for having released the TERp software as Open Source.


PACKAGE CONTENT

  - Main software : MANY is written in Java and make use of TERp and Sphinx4
  - Scripts :
  	MANY.sh : The main script.
	add_id.sh : add id to 1-best output files (must be in the PATH or set in MANY.sh)
	genSphinxConfig.sh : to generate the config file (must be in the PATH or set in MANY.sh)

INSTALL

  - Compiling MANY :

To compile this software, a config file 'build.xml' for ant is provided.
Just run 'ant' (or 'ant -f build.xml') in the 'many' directory.
The library 'MANY.jar' will be available in the 'lib' directory.

  - Copying scripts : 
The scripts provided are the following : MANY.sh, add_id.sh and genSphinx4Config.pl.
User must ensure that the last two scripts are accessible to MANY.sh


USE

  - Prepare experiment : Several variables have to be set in order to run an experiment with MANY. They are all in MANY.sh
  
########### VARIABLES DEFINITION
# Tools
bin_dir=$HOME/bin 				: where to find the tools
add_id=$bin_dir/add_id.sh			: path to the script for adding IDs to hypotheses.
gen_sphinx_config=$bin_dir/genSphinxConfig.pl	: path to the script for generating Sphinx Config file.
many=$bin_dir/MANY.jar				: path to the jar file containing the main program

# Files
many_config="many.config.xml"		: name of the config file for MANY
terp_params="terp.params"		: name of the config file for TERp (even if included in MANY, I did not changed the format)
vocab="lm.vocab"			: the file containing the vocabulary of the LM (typically 1 word per line)
output="output.many"			: the output file
current_dir=`pwd`
working_dir="syscomb"			: the directory where the combination will be done
hypotheses=("out1" "out2" "out3")	: the list of 1-best hypotheses files
priors=(0.4000 0.4000 0.2000)		: the prior probabilities used in the lattice (they are associated with the corresponding hypotheses file)

nb_sys=${#hypotheses[@]}

lmserverhost=TO_SET				: the server hosting the lm-server (with SRILM). This server must be launch as following : ngram -lm <LM_file> -server-port 1324 -unk
lmserverport=TO_SET			: the port to connect to.

fudge=0.2				: the fudge used in the decoder. WARNING : THIS VALUE IS MULTIPLIED BY 10 IN THE SOFT !
null=0.3				: the null penalty applied when crossing a null-arc
length=0.5				: the length penalty. WARNING : THIS VALUE IS MULTIPLIED BY 10 IN THE SOFT !
#costs=(del stem syn ins sub match shift)
costs=(1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0)	: the TERp costs : deletion stem synonym insertion substitution match shift 
clean=1					: set to 1 for cleaning working directory


  - Launch experiment : just run MANY.sh !



KNOWN BUGS
 - Empty lines in hypotheses files provoke an error. -> This is now fixed ! (02/2010)
