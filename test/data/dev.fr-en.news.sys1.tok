This year , in the triangle of Budaörs trade , the usual Christmas Panier daily also grew 16 percent on average , an increase of 1,000 forints much higher value is displayed in all the hypermarkets .

The Unicum and the price of fish living remained almost at the level of the year , though the price of derniere turkey net , the nuts and poppy have soared .

This year , more than 1,000 infections , caused mainly by the misuse of antibiotics , were registered in hospitals .
Many hospitals are also the economy on disinfectants
The antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected on a man hospitalised result was a serious accident .
Earlier this year a similar infection occurred in the same place .
Up to 10 December this year , 1 094 hospitalieres infections generated by a pathogene officer multirésistant were declared the national Systeme hospital-acquired surveillance , said Karolina Böröcz , chief medical officer of the National Centre epidemiology .
About two thirds of infection ( 683 infections ) were caused by the MRSA , i.e. staphylococcus aureus resistant by the méthicilline-oxacilline .
The infection caused by the SA ( such as anginae , amygdalites , skin infections , traumatic infections ) are responding to antibiotics , they are easily cured .
In case of malfunctioning immune systeme or extended the interim , the bacterium can cause serious infections , such as a hospitalieres or a traumatic infection septicemia , on older patients , small or having a weakened body weight .
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic , there is not only the MRSA or they are not trying , said Tibor Nyulasi .
" These patients are isolated , carers puts rubber gloves and protective masks and antibiotics adapted to treat them , " said Tibor Nyulasi .
The prélevement of the sample is not the way
As the infection are particularly evident in the hospitals and homes for elderly people , hospitals should monitor patients and isolate patients carrying MRSA immediately .
We must know that the national social security fund does not finance these tests .
The European Union has strict recommendations was the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and Hungarian directives also exists for curing some infection and syndromes .
The realization of microbiological prélevements is even more rare in outpatient care and basic care , Karolina told Böröcz .
Scientific evidence shows that the patient MRSA proliferent has another most often by medical personnel .
The MRSA proliferent by mosquito-borne infection and by inhaling droplets . However , contact under the circumstances in Hungarian hospitals , the patient infected cannot always be isolated .
Unfortunately , we also note that hospitals in financiere difficult situation , cut back on disinfectants , they are infirmieres , patients are many , and the risk of contamination is even greater , Karolina Böröcz said .
