The skyward zoom in food prices is the dominant force behind the speed up in eurozone inflation .
Official forecasts predicted just 3 percent , Bloomberg said .
The ECB wants to hold inflation to under two percent , or somewhere in that vicinity .
Germany 's November inflation rate of 3.3 percent counts as a record ; in Spain the rate shot up to 4.1 percent from an earlier 3.6 .
Wheat futures were up by 88 percent and soybean prices were at their highest since 1973 .
The world market price of crude oil shot up by 52 percent this year , with the black gold costing nearly 100 dollars a barrel last month .
Analysts see the 12-month inflation rate as holding steady at about 3 percent over the next 3-4 months , but say that the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent .
Government crisis coming , says Gallup
Among people with a clear party preference , given the stronger resolve of opposition voters , Fidesz support exceeds the two-thirds mark ( 71 percent ) , while MSZP has garnered but one-fifth ( 20 percent ) .
Among people with clear party preferences who say they definitely would vote , support for these two parties is 3 percent each .
Following higher hopes in spring and summer , people are again more pessimistic about the financial prospects for their families .
In Gallup 's December poll , more respondents than ever before - 71 percent - said the prime minister was doing a poor rather than a good job .
Fifty-four percent said they did not trust the PM , while 27 percent said they mistrusted the Fidesz chairman .
Following last October 's rioting , 35 percent of the public thought it would be best to keep the government and PM in office . By now that proportion is down to 20 percent and the relative majority ( 33 percent ) believes new elections should be held .
In comparison , only 55 percent said it would definitely vote " in parliamentary elections if they were to be held this Sunday " while another 15 percent said it most likely would cast a ballot . Given current determination to vote , the referendum is certain to be valid .
Looking only at the ratios of people who say they definitely will vote in the referendum , we find that 81 percent are against tuition fees , 84 percent are against doctor co-payments and 89 percent oppose hospital per diems .
The giant supermarkets located in the shopping triangle at Budaörs hiked prices by an average of 16 percent for the second year in a row , though they did not have to contend with a VAT increase which they did last year .
Prices In Napi 's usual Christmas basket were up by an average of 16 percent again this year in the Budaörs shopping triangle , with each of the giant supermarkets pushing prices up by well over a thousand forints .
Nonetheless , it has to be a shock to consumers to discover that they need over ten thousand forints to buy the same products they could get for well under nine thousand a year ago .
The most expensive basket cost us 10 573 forints .
The price of Unicum and live fish stayed at roughly last year 's level , but boneless turkey breast , walnuts , and poppy seeds were up significantly .
The competition factor was not enough to push the product 's price down to under 200 forints .
Nevertheless , this year Napi 's basket cost the most at Auchan and the least at Cora .
The difference between last year 's most expensive and this year 's cheapest basket cost was 12 percent , while the gap between last year 's cheapest and this year 's most expensive one was 21 percent .
Last year , the average increase came to 1,206 forints , which included the effects of a VAT hike .
( If the outlet makes a mistake in calculating the turnover velocity of a product , it stands to take a major hit on its profits with a price gap adjusted to turnover intensity . )
This year , there were no such extremes , with the most expensive basket being 1,630 forints up from last year while the cheapest was 1,284 forints higher .
( This is not quite in line with official Statistics Office data : its figures show price increases of over 30 percent in just 12 months for certain basic foodstuffs
Napi 's basket suggested that this latter was a near impossibility , since we found that the price was up by just a shade over 10 percent on last year 's quite high base price , even where it was most expensive .
Nonetheless , none of the supermarkets in the golden shopping triangle were complaining . All regularly reported that they were having a good year .
They tended to shop in bulk , buying durable foodstuffs by the pallet .
However , to our knowledge , turnover is lower in the rural areas . Several of the multinationals have been complaining to pollsters that their inflow has been below the anticipated level in both groceries and durable consumers .
Hospitals have registered over a thousand cases of infections triggered mainly by the inappropriate use of antibiotics .
Many places even try cutting back on disinfectant use to save money .
The infection was detected in a man who had been hospitalized after a major accident .
The same hospital had had to contend with a similar infection early this year .
This year , up to 10th of December , hospitals have reported 1,094 cases of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System , said National Centre for Epidemiology physician-in-chief Karolina Böröcz .
About two-thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) were caused by MRSAs , whose official name is a methicillin ( oxacillin ) resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The infections SA does cause ( such as sore throat , tonsillitis , minor skin infections , and wound infections ) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated .
Particularly at risk are elderly and low-body-weight patients whose immune systems have been temporarily or permanently compromised . Among these patients , the staph can cause serious nosocomial infections such as wound infections or sepsis .
One should not confuse an infection with an epidemic , Tibor Nyulasi says . MRSA will be found everywhere anyone bothers to test for it , he adds .
" We isolate patients with MRSA and nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks when working with infected patients . We also have the appropriate antibiotics needed to treat them , " says Nyulasi .
Testing for the staph isn 't fashionable
Since this type of infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes , hospitals should routinely check all newly admitted patients and immediately isolate MRSA carriers .
One reason is that the National Health Insurance Fund does not cover the costs of these tests .
The European Union has stringent protocols on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and Hungary has its own guidelines on treating various infections and pathologies .
It is even rarer to take a microbiology sample among outpatients in primary or specialized care , Böröcz added .
Scientific evidence shows that the most common way MRSA is transferred from one patient to another through healthcare personnel who carry it from patient to patient .
MRSAs are transmitted through physical contact and body fluids . Under domestic hospital conditions , an infected patient cannot always be isolated .
Sadly , we also find that when hospitals are short on funds they tend to save on disinfectants , said Böröcz , adding that with a shortage of nursing staff and too many patients , chances of infection increase .
